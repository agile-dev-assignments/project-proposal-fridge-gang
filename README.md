## What and Why?

Fridgey is a mobile/web app that wants to become your go-to place for at-home food management. The app aims to help users track the food in their fridge, notify users when their food is going bad, provide simple analytics on what types of food are in their fridge, and even provide recommendations on what food they should buy next or what recipes they should try based on the food in their fridge with built-in shopping lists.

As college students ourselves, we’ve encountered many instances where we forget about the bag of apples that’s been sitting in the fridge for months, or lose track of the foods we bought when our roommates go grocery shopping. We want to help prevent others from letting their food go bad and help them utilize what they already have to create delicious dishes and maintain a balanced diet.

## For Whom?

This software will be used for those who struggle with keeping track of what is in their fridge. Our target audience would be people who are typically consumed by their outdoor life and pay little attention to the food they consume. This would generally be college students, young adults, and other people who have a lot on their plate….wink. This software can also be shared to their friends and more importantly any other members in a household. Our software would want to alleviate stress on the user and let go of control over an essential part of their daily routine: the meals.

## How?

The features:

1. Create an Account
   - User inputs name, phone numbers, email, connect to facebook friends etc.
2. Tracks the food they have in their fridge
   - To input a food we ask the user
     1. Type of Food
        - Protein/Meats
        - Dairy
        - Grain
        - Fruits/Vegetables
     2. Amount of Food (User selects which unit to use)
        - Number (1-100)
        - Pounds
        - Grams
        - Litres/Millilitres
     3. Set a time of expiration (if they would like, otherwise it will be recommended by our software)
   - These user inputs will allow us to give you reminders of when certain food goes bad etc.
     1. Default: We recommend when you should eat x food by
     2. Option: Users can customize warnings for when to use the food too
   - These user inputs will also allow us to display the food in two different ways
     1. Default filter is the app automatically sorting the food for you into the food groups (meats, dairy, grain, fruits, etc.)
     2. Second filter is a user customizable one where users can group items and name their own groups (eg. For Sunday Brunch)
3. Shopping List
   - Users can make their own lists and our app will also provide recommendations for what they can buy
     - App may also support voiceflow for adding foods via voice command
4. Analytics
   - Based on the food in the fridge, the app will show users ?% of each food type they have (meats, dairy, grain, fruits, etc.)
5. Recommend food recipes based on what you have in your fridge
   - Based on this data, the app will help recommend you recipes and other single food options
   - The recipes can be sourced from third-party websites and our app can help redirect to them and allow users to save those recipes

## Scope

This app would require the integration of a database in order to store items in the “fridge”. Moreover, the application would have to scrape the web for recipes based on the current fridge items. Although the basic concept of our mobile application may seem simple, this idea also allows us to pivot and/or add many more features in the upcoming weeks.

A few additional ideas we could implement on top of the base version of the app if time permits would be advanced food analytics and potential voice detection. As well, we could even implement a social feature where users (for example college roommates) can share the same fridge or connect with their friends’ fridges to collaborate on creating food dishes for get-togethers. Lastly we could even implement recommendentations to nearby stores.
